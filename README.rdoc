== Description

A simple, flexible gem that provides an open-ended API to print colored and styled output in a terminal.

== Installation

Install the gemcutter gem
  ~$ gem install gemcutter
Add gemcutter.org to your gem remote sources
  ~$ gem tumble
Download and install this gem
  ~$ gem install mikowitz-color

== Usage examples

To include this gem in a project
  require 'mikowitz-color'

The following are all methods that <code>Color</code> understands, and should give you an idea of what is possible.

  Color.blue("this will be printed as blue text")
  Color.on_red("this will be printed on a red background")
  Color.bold("this will be bold")
  Color.underline_blue_on_yellow("this will be underlined blue text on a yellow background")

The order of elements in the method name is also unimportant. For example

  Color.bold_underline_blue_on_yellow("This should be formatted the same as the line below")

will look the same as

  Color.on_yellow_bold_blue_underline("This should be formatted the same as the line above")

Check out <code>"spec/term_test.rb"</code> and <code>`rake proof`</code> if you don't believe me.
